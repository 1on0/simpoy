Qadarallah, I'm really sorry to FairEmail, because they have stopped providing their services due to Google falsely flagged FairEmail as spyware without a reasonable opportunity to appeal, as stated on its website. 

The mail client has been irreplaceable on Android for me, come to an end. Though, you can still use their app without their service using an open standard. 

*A good news arrived*

## Update on his website 
Update: <br />

May 30, 2022 <br />
Version 1.1904 is again publicly available in the Play Store, probably after Google's intervention.

### About This Site
This site is powered by Hugo static site generator. I'm using my own Simpoy Theme, under MIT License. Simpoy was named after my cat, Simpoy Theme is not using third party fonts whatsoever, and pretty much influenced by Edward Tufte for fonts and colours.  This theme is using lightGallery script for images and copy clipboard script for copying highlight syntax. Both of them are stored locally, not pushing through another external resources. Even if you're using Firefox with UBO plugin in Hard settings you are good to go.

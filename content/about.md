````$ WHOAMI```` <br />
A &nbsp; طالب العلم &nbsp; knowledge seeker, dedicate this site for personal purposes. Some contents on my site are based on my journey for worldy life which mean nothing and might not benefit for the Hereafter, nor useful for you nor your setup environment. It might be outdated when you are reading this. While some posts here are for my own reminder for the Hereafter, as Anas ibn Malik رضي الله عنه reported: 

{{< font "arabic" "عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ طَلَبُ الْعِلْمِ فَرِيضَةٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ" >}}
_Anas ibn Malik reported: The Prophet ﷺ said, “Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.”_ [^1]  <br />

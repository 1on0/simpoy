## About This Site
This site is powered by ..., and Hugo static site generator. I'm using my own Simpoy Theme, under MIT License. Simpoy was named after my cat, Simpoy Theme is only using only one font; [Adobe-Garamond-Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-garamond) ```font-family: adobe-garamond-pro, serif;```, not using third party fonts whatsoever.  This theme is using lightGallery script for images and copy clipboard script for copying highlight syntax. Both of them are stored locally, not pushing through another external resources. Even if you're using Firefox with UBO plugin in Hard settings you are good to go.

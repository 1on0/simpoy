A miserable chap, was once into pilot, but since the wings had grown on his back the word pilot that he really adored, slowly faded and simply washed away by his wings. Immense ambition of getting birds he loved was on his hands. He worked as a God servant but he never appeared on his office. Unimproved skills he had were nothing. Endless submission on his job, existence of bird he doubted were contaminated with the scum. He thought so much things and couldn't stop thinking until they became a pile on his mind.

Once he flied in the evening, he really enjoyed it. A chance of bumping into people he knew was small. He was on the air, not a land he used to walk in in the evening. He glanced sideways at a bunch of birds but there was one of them, an attractive one, cheerful bird, and he fancied it. He didn't easily fancy something, it seemed in the gross of his opinion that bird had attracted him too much. The bird slowly flied seaward. Did it bode for him to caught this bird? Well, he wondered and the whisper told him to fly closer and catch. It boded a strange, a lovely phenomenon for him.

He called it but still got no answer. He was about to catch and bring it to the cage he owned. He toiled then he made it and the bird had been a vanquisher. That day he vowed he would keep it until the day he set free his bird and never caught again his bird. It was the bird itself that always came back again even if he set free. It ended up with forgetting the lands, a place he was grown up, a part of the earth, the earth that is always said covered by 29.2 % land and 70.8 % ocean, regardless the air itself unlike atmosphere. He started a new journey with unmeasurable miles ahead with the bird he fancied. This was just him from his world no body wouldn't understand.

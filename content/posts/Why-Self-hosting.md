The concept in which we host our own applications, data, and more. Taking away the “unknown” factor in how our data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of our data without losing the functionality of services we otherwise use frequently. That makes us much aware about our own privacy.

***Shaikh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin رحمه الله :*** <br />
Do not think that sustenance is the just for the body, the sustenance of the body will expire. And the human will die and his money will run out. The true provision is provision of the heart. Whoever Allah gives contentment to his heart, then this is the one who is rich. Therefore Allah said in the verse:

{{< font "arabic" "مَنۡ عَمِلَ صَالِحًـا مِّنۡ ذَكَرٍ اَوۡ اُنۡثٰى وَهُوَ مُؤۡمِنٌ فَلَـنُحۡيِيَنَّهٗ حَيٰوةً طَيِّبَةً​ ۚ وَلَـنَجۡزِيَـنَّهُمۡ اَجۡرَهُمۡ بِاَحۡسَنِ مَا كَانُوۡا يَعۡمَلُوۡنَ ٩٧" >}}
_Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer. We will most certainly make him live a happy life and we will surely give him reward in The Hereafter according to the best of what they used to do_ [^1]

Allah did not say we will give him alot of money. Rather, He said we will give him a good life. Meaning, he will be happy inside. His mind will be unstressed and he will be tranquil. Even if he only eats one the whole day and night. For verily, he is happy, cheerful. THIS IS THE LIFE, THE GOOD LIFE.

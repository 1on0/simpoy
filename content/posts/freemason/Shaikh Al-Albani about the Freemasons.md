Shaikh al-Albani Speaks About A Secret Jewish Organization: The Freemasons [^2]
{{< audio "/audio/freemason.mp3" >}}

Questioner: 
We know that Islam has many enemies and form them, thhe Freemasons

Shaikh Al-Albani رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰه :
Yes

Questioner:
Can Our Shaikh speaks  about them, their methods, ideologies and the extent of their effect and danger that they pose to our Islam. May Allah reward you

Shaikh Al-Albani رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰه :
It doesn't concern me at all to speak about The Freemasons, Baathists, Socialist or any other organization, whether it be an open (organization) or a secret one like The Freemasons. It is not really upon us to speak about them in detail, because we believe that all organizations whether they be open or secret do not want good for Islam.

As for The Freemasons, then it is a secret Jewish organization which works by (utilizing) intense plotting. In certain circumstances The Freemasons were able to make some Islamic personalities join them. That is because (The Freemasons) feign to the people that they don't oppose the religioon whatsoever, as they say with us in Sham: "everyone who is upon his own religion, Allah will aid him"

They only pretend to be a charity organization who aid and help each other in affairs that are only connected to ones material life. But the reality is they plot and as Allah says:

{{< /arabic  >}}
_"they were plotting, and Allah is The Best of those who plot"_ [^1]

Just as it is not permissible for a Muslim to be a Socialist, Baathist or a Communist,  then the same way it is not permissible for (a Muslim) to be a Freemasons.
